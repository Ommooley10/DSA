Basics:
1. 1s and 2s complement
2. binary to decimal and vice versa
3. different types of operators : 
    i. Shift (<< (left shift) , >> (right shift))
    ii. AND (&)
    iii. OR (|)
    iv. XOR (^)
    v. NOT (~)

5. Left shift operator: n << k = n * pow(2,k)
6. Right shift operator; n >> k = n / pow(2,k)


Basic questions:

1. Swap two numbers
int a = 5;
int b = 6;
    a = a^b;
    b = a^b;
    a = a^b;


2. Check if the ith bit is set or not 
int N;
if(N & (1 << i) != 0){
    cout << "The bit is set"
}else{
    cout << "The bit is not set"
}


3. Set the ith bit (make the value of the ith bit equal to 1)
int N
N | (1 << i)  (OR operator is used to set the bit)


4. Clear the ith bit (make the value of the ith bit equal to 0)
int N;
N & (~(1 << i))   (AND operator is used to clear the bit)


5. Toggle the ith bit
int N 
N ^ (1 << i)   (XOR operator is used to toggle the bit)

6. Toggle the rightmost set bit
int N
N & (N - 1)
