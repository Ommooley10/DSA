For linked list questions:
The following patterns are important:

1. The tortoise and hare algorithm: require two pointers:- fast and slow
2. Creating a dummy linked list with -1 value i.e ListNode* dummyNode = new ListNode(-1);
3. Changing the links of the two linked lists.
4. Keep track of the position of pointer while incrementing it, sometimes the count is to be started from 1 instead of 0.
5. Some questions require keeping the track of the previous node, specially while deleting a particular node from the LL.
6. ALWAYS INITIALIZE THE COUNT VARIABLE TO 1 COZ LINKED LIST IS 1 BASED INDEXING.
        preferably to this: 
        int count = 1;
        for(count < pos){
            temp = temp->next;
            count++;
        }
