For identifying heap problems look for the above things:

1. words like kth smallest, kth largest (basically smallest and largest with an integer k given in question)
2. if kth smallest is asked then use maxHeap
3. if kth largest is asked, use minHeap

4. median problems
5. in problems where sorting is necessary, try figuring out the approach using heap first
6. where an increasing or decreasing order needs to be maintained
7. merge sorted lists, merge sorted arrays


DECLARATION:

1. minHeap: priority_queue<int, vector<int>, greater<int>> minHeap;
2. maxHeap: priority_queue<int> maxHeap;
